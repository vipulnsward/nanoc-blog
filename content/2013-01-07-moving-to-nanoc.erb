I had been blogging in the past at aknv.wordpress.com. I have shifted here from wordpress.

The blog is hosted over an EC2 instance, that fetches data from the blogs github repo.

I have used <a href="http://http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">Nanoc</a> a ruby publishing system, modified to fit my needs.
There are many others out there, but Nanoc is pretty simple and unique in the way it builds.

<a href="http://thomas.pelletier.im/2012/02/switching-to-nanoc/"> This</a> article hepled me to set up the autobuild process.
Its a sinatra app which is triggered by post-commit hooks from the github-repo, and on being hit refreshes the remote repo,
with current data.

Hope to publish more of my work here, moving ahead.
