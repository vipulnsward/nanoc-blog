I love creating beautiful Solutions or Optimizing things.
I am currently available for helping about this.

I can help you Bootstrap your Application. Or refactor and help scale up your existing Apps.

Tools I use are Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Coffescript, Rubymotion. If what you are looking for isn't listed in these, I can still be of help.
